In 2023, the global IP outsourcing market was valued at approximately $6 billion and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10% from 2024 to 2032.</p> <p>The ongoing digital transformation and advancements in technology are also propelling the growth of this market. As organizations strive to enhance their operational efficiencies, many are opting to outsource IP management tasks such as patent searches, trademark registrations, and IP litigation support. By 2025, the market size is expected to reach around $8 billion, and by 2032, it is projected to exceed $15 billion. Furthermore, the increasing realization of the value of IP as a revenue-generating asset is encouraging more companies to seek professional assistance in managing and monetizing their portfolios.</p> <span></span> <p>Moreover, the rising global competition means that businesses are investing more in research and development, which in turn boosts the demand for patentable inventions and effective IP strategies.
